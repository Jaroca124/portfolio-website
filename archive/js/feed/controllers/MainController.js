      comment: "Pattern Lab is an incredibly powerful atomic design system that allows for rapid frontend development. The principle behind Pattern Lab and atomic design is that web components can be distilled into their most basic form, such as color, font, and button style, which are called atoms. Atoms can be combined to create molecules, like a search bar consisting of a button and an input field. Molecules can be combined to create organisms, such as a navigation bar, and finally, organisms can be used to create templates. When templates are supplied with data, they become full-fledged pages. The power of Pattern Lab is in its modularity â€“ when you make a change to a button, for example, the same change will be applied everywhere that button appears. I am currently using Pattern Lab to build out a personal project and I highly recommend looking into it!",

      comment: "I had the pleasure of working with Dana briefly on client site through Booz Allen. She is a UX rockstar who, unfortunately for me, is leaving the company to work at an exciting new startup. Dana wrote this article describing how UX can be more effectively incorporated into the Agile development process and keep designers and developers happy and productive.",

      comment: "Here's an interesting article by Laurence Pilon that details the differences between UI and UX. I particularly like the portion that contrasts what people think UX is with what it actually is. We UX-ers have a critical role to play, not just in the visual design of a system, but also in the design of its structure, functionality, and usability.",
