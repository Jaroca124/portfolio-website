                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>The VFT Design team had little experience with gardening tools and processes prior to the development of ApportechTM. In order to get a better understanding, the team started the design process by conducting initial web-based research. Specifically, the team looked at gardening store websites, videos, product reviews, and general gardening information. This preliminary research helped the team gain a better grasp on current gardening practices and tools. With this initial context in mind, the team was able to brainstorm a list of questions that we still had about gardening and various gardening tools. Once we had these questions, along with our initial research, we were able to begin thinking about our informal observation visits.</p>

To conduct our informal observations, the team visited two different locations. The purpose of these observations was to get a firsthand look at some of the products currently on the market. The first location visited was Home Depot in Assembly Square, MA. The second site visited was Mahoney’s Garden Center located in Winchester, MA. Mahoney’s had three greenhouses with a variety of plants to purchase. With our initial research and informal observations complete, the team still had some questions about gardening practices and tools. Keeping the research and observations in mind, the team moved on to begin creating an initial survey to help address some of these unanswered questions.</p>

Please see Appendix C for the full survey.  We asked participants about the tools they currently use to water, fertilize, and seed. We were interested in the advantages and disadvantages of their current tools and we wanted to understand, in a general sense, what potential users would value most in a new product across dimensions such as price, durability, ease of use, etc. We returned to Mahoney’s Garden Center to administer this initial survey. The reactions of participants to this initial survey were extremely valuable. The team was able to find several issues with this initial survey that needed fixing. With these issues in mind, the team moved on to revising the survey and collecting more results.</p>

We determined that the most relevant information for our purposes had to do with the issues associated with current products. Thus, we focused on including questions that uncovered these shortcomings. Another issue with the initial survey had to do with the fact that it was presented on a mobile device. This made us rethink how we were going to present our survey; Google Forms is significantly more conducive to online data collection as opposed to in person collection, thus we decided to send the survey out by email and through online gardening forums. The results of the survey provided us with very important information for what our device needed to accomplish and what factors were most important for users of the device. With this information in mind, we closely analyzed the different responses to begin thinking about user needs and requirements.</p>

One important user need we discovered from the survey results was that users needed the device to be able to distribute different types of fertilizer. This required us to design a device that would distribute both granular and liquid fertilizer, an important characteristic that would affect the mechanics our design. At this stage, the team felt that these needs and requirements could be successfully verified and validated once we settled on our winning design concept. Furthermore, these user needs and requirements were important to keep in mind moving forward. Ultimately, our designs needed to adhere to these requirements. The next stage was initial concept creation, for which the team brainstormed different designs, keeping the recently created requirements in mind.</p>

With our recently created requirements, we brainstormed a list of features and solutions. We wrote different ideas on sticky notes and pinned them to a board with different category groupings. After this initial brainstorm, each team member voted on a few features and ideas that they liked. We strongly considered the features that received the most votes. The team was satisfied with these initial concepts. With three concepts for both the handpiece and the container, the team had a solid array of design options, each boasting a variety of different features. In order to test the feasibility of our designs against some pre-defined standards, the team conducted a heuristic review.</p>

The heuristics set used was Nielsen’s Heuristics for User Interface Design. While these heuristics are specifically meant to address digital user interfaces, we determined that they would still be applicable to the physical design of ApportechTM. To begin, the team conducted a group heuristic review on our first nozzle design. After this review, each member of the team conducted a solo heuristic review on one of our five remaining nozzle or container designs. Once these heuristic reviews were conducted, the team met again to discuss the findings. Ultimately, the heuristic reviews allowed the team to compare the initial concepts to widely accepted standards. This allowed us to see what gaps in the design we had not previously considered. These reviews helped us to ensure that we had covered our bases. With more confidence in our initial concepts, the team met to narrow down our design options.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>After conducting a heuristic review on each of our six concept designs, the team decided to refine the concepts before taking them to the field for use in structured interviews. The team aimed to create two polarizing design concepts both for the handle and container, for a total of four design concepts. Creating two polarizing concepts for both the handpiece and the containers prepared the team to discover which features were the most valuable through in-depth interviews. These interviews would ultimately enhance our understanding of what users would want out of a product such as ApportechTM.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>The participants (N=5) for the team’s in-depth interviews mainly specialized in home, flower, and vegetable gardening as well as yard landscaping. Four participants were females with ages ranging from 52-57, and one was an 18-year-old male. The interviewees all had substantial gardening experience, ranging from 6 to 30 years, which included both indoor and outdoor gardening. The interviews were administered over the phone or in-person. These interviews proved to be very useful as they not only indicated strong preference to a handpiece and carrier design over the others, but also brought forward some universal concerns as well as helpful recommendations for the designs moving forward. The team consolidated this feedback into a single design for both the handpiece and the container. The handpiece design kept most of the features from the Raygun concept, but added a scroller dial for speed flow selection based on participant’s reactions. For the container, the team selected the Mail Carrier Cart design due to weight concerns with the backpack, and made the material containers removable from the cart body to enable easier fill up. Finally, the in-depth interviews confirmed that the water container should be the largest of the three material containers.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>To prepare for the hazard identification process, the team began to put together a hierarchical task analysis for the different steps involved in using ApportechTM to water and fertilize a ten foot garden. To do this, we brainstormed some of the larger steps associated with a hypothetical gardening session in a spreadsheet and then began breaking down those steps into smaller sub-steps. We stipulated that users could not walk through the garden for this task because we wanted to analyze the extension and flow rate capabilities of the device. Overall, the tasks involved in operating the device seemed fairly simple and reflected the major design aspects of ApportechTM. We were able to break down the tasks into six major steps and break down those major steps into at least five sub-steps. This HTA served as direct input to our hazard identification, a method which considers potential failures at each stage of a task.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>For the hazard identification process, the team began brainstorming different use errors and hazardous situations for the steps of the HTA. Once we had a comprehensive list of use errors and hazardous situations, we began filling in the rest of the hazard identification table. For each situation, we assessed the type of harm to the user, the level of severity, and the justification for that severity level. Once we had completed these columns, we assessed the different P2s, or the probability of the hazard leading to harm. Finally, we reviewed the hazard ID table again to verify and validate that the hazards and the P2s we initially came up with were accurate. Our final hazard identification chart consisted of twelve different use errors and hazardous situations. Only two of the hazards were listed as “Probable” for the likeliness that they would lead to harm. The rest of the hazard P2’s were listed as “Occasional” or less. The severity levels varied in their ranking from very low to high. After completing our hazard ID, the team had P2s and severity levels that could be used in combination with a use-related risk assessment to uncover risk ratings. In parallel with this risk assessment, the team created an initial product prototype.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>Creating the initial product prototype was an essential step to the project as whole. Having a device that participants could physically interact with allowed the team to get specific input on our design (see the usability test section below). This task extended over the course of two weeks, and ran parallel with our risk assessment. In order to create this initial prototype, team members went to a local hardware store and purchased a caulk gun. The caulk gun was modded by removing the metal rod and bolting it to retain the trigger’s elasticity. We then unscrewed a hose nozzle to separate the head, and attached the head to a roll of cardboard. This cardboard roll was slightly smaller than a cardboard sheath attached to the body of the caulk gun. This allowed the nozzle to slide in and out, representing the extender feature. We surrounded the body with cardboard and secured it with tape. A computer mouse was fastened to the body to mimic the speed flow scroll dial. Finally, the prototype was wrapped with duct tape for extra strength and style. Error lights, buttons, and labels were drawn on in sharpie. he team was satisfied with the development of the initial prototype. The prototype was a product of the conclusions reached after conducting a wide variety of Human Factors methods.</p>

                        <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>The objective of a risk analysis is to identify potential risks involved in using the product. Once these risks are identified, mitigation strategies are employed to improve the overall design and safety of the product. We had already performed a task analysis and a hazard ID for our device, so we used the information gathered from those steps to inform our use-related risk assessment. The team outlined potential failure modes and their causes for each task.  In addition, we noted the severity and P2 levels previously determined in our hazard ID. Referencing the corresponding table, we found the P1s for each failure mode, or the likelihood of the hazardous situation occurring. Using the P1 and P2 levels, we were able to determine the likelihood of each failure mode (P1 x P2). The resulting likelihood level was then used with the severity level (Likelihood x Severity) from our hazard ID to determine risk. The risk assessment proved to provide valuable insights into how we could improve the safety and mitigate the risk of our device which, in turn, improved the overall design.</p>

The team started by creating a test plan. The plan was reviewed by Human Factors specialist Maureen Mulcare in order to ensure that it was complete and robust. This plan outlined objectives, test environment, target participants, objective measures, and subjective measures, to name a few components. Generally, our primary objective was to assess the usability of the device in relation to each task. After analyzing common themes and calculating means from our quantitative data, the team made several improvements to our final design. In general, participants liked the prototype design and found it generally easy to use.  Although the prototype needed a few changes and improvements, all five participants said that they would recommend the product. Following the usability testing, we made modifications to our final prototype based on our analysis.</p>

From paper to a physical prototype, improvements were made and design changes occurred. Our final prototype is a two part system: a handpiece connected by tubes to a carrying cart. After receiving the necessary materials, we completed the carrier and handpiece. Overall, the team has successfully followed the predetermined Gantt chart/project plan and, when needed, adjusted it accordingly. Throughout this process, the team strived to use the knowledge learned from each method to inform the next, in order to best serve the users’ needs and preferences through design. We are confident that both the Human Factors design process and our application of the methods have culminated in an innovative solution to a 3-in-1 horticultural product.
