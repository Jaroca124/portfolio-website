The team learned about Galaxy’s role within the community and the types of interactions that users might have while using the website. The team set up a weekly meeting time in order to maintain consistent contact with Red Hat sponsors.</p>

A variety of different sources were reviewed, covering topics from current impressions of Ansible Galaxy to typical IT tasks. Each article was reviewed by team members and a final bulleted list for each article was compiled.

A heuristic analysis is a method of comparing products along a set of predefined characteristics. The team used Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for Good User Interface Design (Nielsen, 1995). This set defines ten separate metrics, such as error recovery and overall aesthetic quality. This heuristic review provided us with a bird’s eye view qualitative assessment of each of the three evaluated platforms, which served as a crucial stepping stone in extrapolating a quantitative analysis in our expert review. This heuristic review served as an effective and succinct platform from which we could begin to identify possible missed use-cases. The review ultimately helped to inform our creation of user needs by informing the development of survey items.</p>

Each member of the team ranked each platform on a scale of 0-5 for a variety of metrics defined by the team (i.e. “Ease of browsing”). This provided a more quantitative set of metrics for comparing overall quality of each site’s user experience as well as an item by item comparison of which sites have better flows for specific tasks. Similar to the heuristic review, this helped the team concentrate the survey questionnaire items in order to uncover user needs from areas where Ansible Galaxy could specifically be improved.</p>

This survey was piloted to Red Hat sponsors, Dr. Aurelio (professor of Capstone course), and a current TTS employee. The team modified the survey according to the feedback received, ensuring that the survey would generate applicable and relevant information. This survey was then distributed to locally accessible system administrators, members of the Ansible Galaxy User community through Red Hat sponsors, and IT professionals on a Reddit Ansible community forum. The team had initially proposed to reach out to Ansible Galaxy users via their GitHub repositories, however, this process would have been less

The qualitative questionnaire results were coded by identifying themes and tallying up responses that fell into each category. In total, 18 responses were considered in our results analysis.

Good IT automation platforms such as Ansible Galaxy need to host reliable content, support easy interaction, and offer a variety of choices.  Conversely, less satisfactory platforms lack curated lists, provide poorly coded modules, and ineffective or incomplete documentation. The methods conducted by the Andromeda team resulted in the development of a set of ten user needs that ultimately factored into initial concept generation.</p>

screens meant primarily to convey different fundamental solutions to the high priority functionalities of
Ansible Galaxy, we felt that a Demonstration-Reaction approach would best suit our research needs.
Rather than skipping straight to a more detailed mockup with a more rigorous form of design feedback
to go along with it, Andromeda saw clear benefits to talking through our concepts with a small sample of
experts and users first. By having these unstructured discussions, the team’s goal was to both verify the
strengths and weaknesses of the concepts as well as gather outside perspectives on possible alternative
solutions for each feature. More concretely, the purpose of these interviews was to ultimately
determine the best two concepts for each feature.</p>

As the team prepared to move to a higher level of fidelity, our next step was to design two alternative,
interactive mockups of Ansible Galaxy as a whole. Naturally, these mockups would be largely comprised of
the components developed and tested up to this point as individual features. While each alternative
prototype broadly employed one of the two preferred solutions for each feature, Andromeda also took the qualitative suggestions and ideas gathered in this round of feedback into account during
the next stage of design.</p>

feature set and thus gather the feedback necessary to begin constructing a final, high fidelity website
design. The team utilized the feedback from this round to determine whether the final concept for each
feature would be one of our two alternate concepts, some combination of them, or a new concept

used these rankings in combination with rankings from the first round of demonstration and reaction
sessions in order to determine which concepts would not move on to the next design round. The results
from the first round were comparable in most cases because participants had been shown the same two
concepts as in Round 2, in addition to a third which has already been eliminated. We adjusted Round 1
rankings to be compatible (first choice, not first choice) with Round 2 rankings and used them to
supplement the six data points we gathered in Round 2. Finally, because we had limited feedback from
true Galaxy users, we weighted the three data points from these users in order to make our decisions as
user-centered as possible. This informed our “weighted” vote totals. We simply doubled votes by Galaxy
users (highlighted in purple below) in order to create these weighted totals. For each feature (with the exception of the bookmarks feature), the concept with the highest weighted ranking will be used in our final aesthetic concepts.</p>
