                <p class="mt-4">I served as a board member on the Tufts Human Factors &amp; Ergonomics Society starting my freshman year. This society was designed to support underclassmen as they choose their fields of study and to create social events for students in the major. After two years on the board, I become the treasurer. In this role, I was in charge of outlining our yearly budget and coordinating with the Tufts Treasury to gain approval.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">I played Tufts Club B soccer for two years before budget cuts ended the team. As captain starting my junior year, I helped our team disaffiliate from the university to become an independent club team, competing in the same league that we played in before the budget cuts. The team has become stronger over time.</p>
