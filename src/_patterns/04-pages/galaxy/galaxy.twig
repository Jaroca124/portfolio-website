This website supplements the Ansible platform, which is used for automating IT processes. Ansible is a large suite of tools that are utilized both through command line and web interfaces. Galaxy is a unified repository of brilliant IT automation solutions created for the Ansible platform that people from all over the world have shared. Anyone can download roles that another user has contributed. Our team's ongoing mission is to enhance this service even further by applying principles of user-centered design in order to bring an unparalleled experience to its users.</p>

The team learned about Galaxy’s role within the community and the types of interactions that users might have while using the website.

A heuristic analysis is a method of comparing products along a set of predefined characteristics. The team used Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for Good User Interface Design (Nielsen, 1995). This set defines ten separate metrics, such as error recovery and overall aesthetic quality. This heuristic review provided us with a bird’s eye view qualitative assessment of each of the three evaluated platforms, which served as a crucial stepping stone in extrapolating a quantitative analysis in our expert review. This heuristic review served as an effective and succinct platform from which we could begin to identify possible missed use-cases. The review ultimately helped to inform our creation of user needs by informing the development of survey items.</p>

Each member of the team ranked each platform on a scale of 0-5 for a variety of metrics defined by the team (i.e. “Ease of browsing”). This provided a more quantitative set of metrics for comparing overall quality of each site’s user experience as well as an item by item comparison of which sites have better flows for specific tasks. Similar to the heuristic review, this helped the team concentrate the survey questionnaire items in order to uncover user needs from areas where Ansible Galaxy could specifically be improved.</p>

In order to do so, we utilized our preliminary findings to develop a structured survey for current and potential users about their needs. This survey was piloted to Red Hat sponsors, Dr. Aurelio (professor of Capstone course), and a current TTS employee. The team modified the survey according to the feedback received, ensuring that the survey would generate applicable and relevant information. This survey was then distributed to locally accessible system administrators, members of the Ansible Galaxy User community through Red Hat sponsors, and IT professionals on a Reddit Ansible community forum. The team had initially proposed to reach out to Ansible Galaxy users via their GitHub repositories, however, this process would have been less efficient than the one conducted.</p>

Good IT automation platforms such as Ansible Galaxy need to host reliable content, support easy interaction, and offer a variety of choices.  Conversely, less satisfactory platforms lack curated lists, provide poorly coded modules, and ineffective or incomplete documentation. The methods conducted by the Andromeda team resulted in the development of a set of ten user needs that ultimately factored into initial concept generation.</p>

This process contained three stages. In the first stage, the team would develop a set of features for inclusion in the redesign. For each of these features, three different concepts would be created. After usability testing, the team would eliminate one of these three concepts. In the second stage, the two remaining concepts would be divided among two low-fidelity prototypes. Another round of usability testing would reveal the single winning concept per feature. Stage three would involve aesthetic concept testing and refinement.</p>

The team performed a brainstorming exercise in which each member wrote singular features or concepts on Post-Its for consideration and inclusion in the new designs. The team had three minutes to write as many features as possible. In this stage, no ideas were discouraged; the purpose was to generate as many ideas as possible. Following this exercise, the team grouped the Post-Its together under high-level categories as well as ratings for importance of inclusion in the redesign.</p>

The purpose of this exercise was to brainstorm differences in features for presentation to users. Upon returning from Thanksgiving Break, the team met to determine which features were going to be included in the first round of concept development. Some of the features that we came up with in our brainstorming activity relied too heavily on aesthetic design. For this reason, the team decided to hold off on developing these concepts until the next round, where style would be a principal focus.</p>

With a low fidelity series of screens meant primarily to convey different fundamental solutions to the high priority functionalities of Ansible Galaxy, we felt that a Demonstration-Reaction approach would best suit our research needs. Rather than skipping straight to a more detailed mockup with a more rigorous form of design feedback to go along with it, Andromeda saw clear benefits to talking through our concepts with a small sample of experts and users first. By having these unstructured discussions, the team’s goal was to both verify the strengths and weaknesses of the concepts as well as gather outside perspectives on possible alternative solutions for each feature. More concretely, the purpose of these interviews was to ultimately determine the best two concepts for each feature.</p>

The concept with the worst ranking (highlighted in red in the image to the right) was removed from further consideration, after reviewing and considering the qualitative comments that were gathered from participants. As the team prepared to move to a higher level of fidelity, our next step was to design two alternative, interactive mockups of Ansible Galaxy as a whole. Naturally, these mockups would be largely comprised of the components developed and tested up to this point as individual features. While each alternative prototype broadly employed one of the two preferred solutions for each feature, Andromeda also took the qualitative suggestions and ideas gathered in this round of feedback into account during the next stage of design.</p>

First, participants’ rank order preferences of concepts for each feature were recorded in a spreadsheet. We used these rankings in combination with rankings from the first round of demonstration and reaction sessions in order to determine which concepts would not move on to the next design round. The results from the first round were comparable in most cases because participants had been shown the same two concepts as in Round 2, in addition to a third which has already been eliminated. We adjusted Round 1 rankings to be compatible (first choice, not first choice) with Round 2 rankings and used them to supplement the six data points we gathered in Round 2. Finally, because we had limited feedback from true Galaxy users, we weighted the three data points from these users in order to make our decisions as user-centered as possible. This informed our “weighted” vote totals. We simply doubled votes by Galaxy users (highlighted in purple below) in order to create these weighted totals. For each feature (with the exception of the bookmarks feature), the concept with the highest weighted ranking will be used in our final aesthetic concepts.</p>
