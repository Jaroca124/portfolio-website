    "metaDescription": "I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and in anticipation of Avengers: Endgame which released in early 2019, my friends and I watched one of the Marvel movies every Sunday. Shortly after our Marvelthon started, I created a design concept for a hypothetical MCU movie app, in which users could view the whole series of films, learn more about their favorite characters, and get more details about the movies."
