My research team is exploring the novel concept of Continuously Adjustable Autonomy (CAA), an extension of Adjustable Autonomy (AA). AA is the process by which manual control is leveraged in a human-in-the-loop system when the operator becomes stressed or overly taxed, thus increasing the chance of human error. When this happens, the machine in the system will assume more control until the operator can return his or her full focus to the system. In CAA, the autonomy algorithm responsible for this change in manual control will modulate levels of autonomy on a continuous scale as opposed to a discrete shift. We hypothesize that this will be beneficial to team performance due to more precise tuning of manual control relative to the cognitive state of the operator.</p>

Due to varying shapes of the brain across individuals, this method unfortunately lacks in spatial resolution, or the ability to determine what part of the brain the signals are coming from.

Therefore, I hypothesized that the higher the skin conductance of the drone pilot, the more stressed they would be.

In other words, I matched my own self-reported stress response with the data recorded during that time (done via watching a video recording taken during the trial). I analyzed the video for any salient features of the data, such as extraneous arm movements or “close calls” in which I almost flew the drone into an object.

I connected the camera to an Arduino 101. Next, I cut out bright colored paper and tuned the camera to distinguish between different colors. Once I had an understanding of how the Pixy Cam operated, I faced the problem of how I was going to use this solution with the experiment. I envisioned a setup in which the drone operator would wear the camera and Arduino on his/her head. The pilot would fly a drone with a magenta colored marker in his/her field of view. The operator would be periodically interrupted by a secondary task displayed on a monitor to their side. On this secondary task monitor, a lime green blob would be placed. When the operator turned his/her head to manage the secondary task, the Pixy Cam would detect their head orientation by recognizing the lime green blob as opposed to the magenta blob. In addition to this color detection system, I utilized the built-in inertial measurement unit (IMU) of the Arduino 101. The IMU can determine the orientation of the Arduino in space. I integrated the Arduino into the Pixy Cam setup as a failsafe for head positioning. With this implementation, I used the Pixy Cam and Arduino to infer the “visual attention” of the operator. If the operator is not looking at the drone, the autonomy algorithm would register the pilot as “distracted.”</p>

                            <p class='my-4 mx-3 section_description'>After the summer, I continued my research with the CABCS as an independent research credit for Tufts University (Fall 2016). My principle role during this semester was to validate our Continuously Adjustable Autonomy (CAA) concept by creating a simulation of the proposed drone behavior for the experiment. When the participant in our experiment is interrupted by the secondary task, the autonomy algorithm will “ramp down” the velocity of the drone over a certain period of time, t. If the operator continues to manage the secondary task for longer than t, the drone will come to a complete stop. My job was to determine if there was an optimal t for which the overall experiment trial time would be optimized. I coded this simulation using VBA in Excel. As shown to the right, I found t to be close to 9 seconds. This t would serve as the ramp down for the CAA condition of the experiment. This number proved to be misleading, however, as changing some critical values in the simulation, such as the distances between targets, did not affect the 9 second t. For our participant experiment, we decided to test whether or not our ramp-down automation scheme with an arbitrary ramp-down time would result in easier experiences and thus shorter times of completion over locked, current velocity on look-away.</p>

My main task during the semester was to create a virtual experiment in order to act as a fail-safe in case our drone hardware proved too difficult to manage. I modelled the virtual experiment in Unity and participants performed the experiment using a game controller. In the end, we ran about 8 participants and gathered data on their performances. When I graduated in May, 2017, I handed over the datasets to my PM, completing my work with the CABCS. I hope that the data will prove useful to our mission, and that a paper may be published on the results!</p>
